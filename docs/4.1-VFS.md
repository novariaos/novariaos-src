# Virtual File System
The Virtual File System (VFS) is a unified interface for working with different types of files and devices in an operating system. It provides abstraction over real file systems, input/output devices, and pseudo-files, allowing them to be accessed through a single API.

## Key concepts

### Types of VFS objects
- Regular files: store data in memory
- Directories: organize the hierarchical structure of files
- Device: provide an interface to hardware drivers
- Pseudo: special files for interaction with system

### File Descriptors
Each open file is assigned a unique numerical identifier:
- `0`: stdin
- `1`: stdout
- `2`: stderr
- `3+`: user's files

### CAPS
- `VFS_READ`
- `VFS_WRITE`
- `VFS_CREAT`

## Key features

### File management
- Create and delete file
- Open and close file
- Read write data
- Seek

### Directory managment
- Create and delete directory
- Recursive deletion
- Viewing content

### Work with devices
- Registering drivers as files
- Direct access through input/output operations
- Control via ioctl

### Special devices
- `/dev/null`
- `/dev/full`
- `/dev/zero`
- stdin/stdout


## Features of implementation

### Pseudofiles
Some files do not store data, but represent interfaces:
- Files in /proc: information about processes
- Files in /dev: system devices
- Special files for debugging (like /var/log/system.log)

### Error handling
The system returns standard error codes:
- `ENOENT`: file not found
- `EACCES`: access denied
- `ENOTDIR`: is not directory
- `ENOSPC`: no space left on device


### Restrictions
- Maximum file name length: 256b
- Maximum file size: 65536b
- Maximum number of open files: 64
